I wish if I could write down step 1, step 2, step 3 to get your first job. Unfortunately things aren't that certain and a lot of factors play role. So rather than making this article "Do this to get your first job" It's more of a "I did this. Maybe try if it works for you?" 

Not related to tech but do watch ["Is Success Luck or Hard Work?" by Veritasium on YouTube](https://youtu.be/3LopI4YeC4I)
