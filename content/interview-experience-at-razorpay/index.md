I wish if I could write down step 1, step 2, step 3 to get your first job. Unfortunately, things aren't that certain and a lot of factors play role. So rather than making this article "Do this to get your first job" It's more of a "I did this. Maybe try and see if it works for you?" 

**TLDR;**

## Getting The Interview

### Year 2016, 2nd Semester of Engineering 

We had a genuinely good professor for programming. She taught us so well and I started liking programming. I had introduction to programming at few instances before but this was pretty much the point where I learnt most of the programming that I know today.

Later started exploring web on my own (tried android -> didn't work on my low-end laptop -> gave up). 

Started learning HTML, CSS, and <s>JavaScript</s> PHP. 

Fun fact: I hated JavaScript!

### Early 2018, Learning JavaScript (not really)

I did an internship on Node.js (Learnt Node.js before Frontend JavaScript lol) and Angular (Again, Before Frontend JavaScript) and was doing another internship on Vue.js. The way I learnt frameworks and languages was a mess but it just eventually worked. 

During this time I decided I am going to create GitHub account and just put my projects there (basically use it as a Google Drive for Projects) and I did. 

Here's a picture from my first repository-
![hello-world, Just getting started with my github account, Hello World! My name is Saurabh Daware. I am from Mumbai, India. I love Space and Programming !!. I am a web developer more specifically a MEAN stack developer. So I will be posting my MEAN stack applications here Tune in for some really cool applications ! :)](assets/hello-world-repo.png)

*Alt: Hello World! My name is Saurabh Daware. I am from Mumbai, India. I love Space and Programming !!. I am a web developer more specifically a MEAN stack developer. So I will be posting my MEAN stack applications here Tune in for some really cool applications ! :)*

This introduction is very accurate representation of 18-year-old Saurabh.

P.S. Unpopular opinion but I hate the terms MEAN and MERN.

### Late 2018 - Early 2019, Building Projects

I built lots of useless but super fun things and that taught a lot about web and JavaScript in general. Building a boring game (never even released it) helped me learn JavaScript the most. I was very popular on GitHub during this time (Sarcasm). Had 8 stars on all my projects combined and no one really used my projects. Just some of my college friends and my mom (thanks mum ;__;) 

### Late 2019, Sharing Projects

I was seeing all the cool projects that people were sharing on [dev.to](https://dev.to) and that inspired me to share my projects. Wrote [my first article about my project, PWAinit](https://dev.to/saurabhdaware/turn-existing-website-to-pwa-in-1-minute-using-pwainit-8do) and guess what? I got 7 stars in 2 days! This was more stars than I had received in the last 2 years.

It was nice to see people actually using my project and that inspired me to write more and just then I joined Twitter to share articles!

Basically sharing projects in articles, then sharing articles on Twitter.

I met some very kind people on Twitter who gave me shoutouts and helped me throughout and still help whenever I reach out to them.


### Late 2020, Getting the Razorpay Interview

One year of using Twitter and I had met some absolutely amazing people. On a random day, I made a tweet sharing my rebuilt resume and I get this message from [Kamlesh](https://twitter.com/_kamlesh_).

Ok let me mention this before we move ahead- This is a very short article so I only highlighted the goods. Here's a short list of all the bads-
- I was soo tired of failing interviews that I did not apply to jobs for almost 3 months.
- During internship, I was doing college in the morning, internship in the evening and was travelling between 3 different cities everyday. This was very tiring and my mental health was a mess. (Don't do this to yourself, please)
- I was trying to earn through projects, failed.
- Don't even get me started with the personal issues lol ðŸ˜­
