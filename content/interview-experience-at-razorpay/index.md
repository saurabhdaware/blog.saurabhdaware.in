I wish if I could write down step 1, step 2, step 3 to get your first job. Unfortunately things aren't that certain and a lot of factors play role. So rather than making this article "Do this to get your first job" It's more of a "I did this. Maybe try and see if it works for you?"

## Getting the Interview

### Tech Journey So Far

**Year 2016-**

I started my Bachelor's. I wasn't sure if I really want to choose coding as a career. All I knew was I like computers and if I do this I can make games (17 year-old me was freaking out over the idea of making my own GTA San Andreas).


Not related to tech but do watch ["Is Success Luck or Hard Work?" by Veritasium on YouTube](https://youtu.be/3LopI4YeC4I).
