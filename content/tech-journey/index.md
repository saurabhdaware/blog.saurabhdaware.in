I wish if I could write down step 1, step 2, step 3 to get your first job. Unfortunately things aren't that certain and a lot of factors play role. So rather than making this article "Do this to get your first job" It's more of a "I did this. Maybe try and see if it works for you?" 

**TLDR;**

## Getting the Interview

### Learning to Code

I started seriously looking into programming as a career option in my second year of college. We had an amazing professor and I learnt most of my coding basics from her. Then I eventually started exploring things on my own and came across Android Development. The android builds were taking too long on my low end laptop so gave up on Android and explored web which just worked pretty well without any complicated setup!

My way of learning was pretty messy it just somehow worked eventually ðŸ˜…. I learnt HTML/CSS/PHP first (without JavaScript since most of the things I was building were static). During this time I was mostly busy hating on JavaScript thinking why do we even need it if I can just build a website with HTML, CSS, and PHP.

Then I got an internship at a startup through [Internshala](https://internshala.com/). I had built some static HTML/CSS websites till then so they were happy to see my projects and offered a 3-month internship on basis of that. Now here's where it gets fun- The internship was majorly around Node.js and I had no idea what Node.js even is. So I leart Node.js and little bit of Angular for frontend and finished that internship. I had started liking Angular and Node and built some projects around it ([My hello-world GitHub Repository](https://github.com/saurabhdaware/hello-world) is a great representation of 18-year-old Saurabh). I learnt most of my JavaScript while trying to figure out Node and Angular. 

Later I got another internship at [thesouledstore.com](https://thesouledstore.com) through Linkedin (Again in the interview they were happy to see my earlier projects). I worked there on Vue.js for 2 months. I didn't know Vue.js properly. I was mostly searching for the parts that I need, to complete that particular task and just eventually learnt the Vue this way. I started understanding the idea of frameworks and everything that I did in Angular at my last internship, started making sense to me after this.

I continued building projects in JavaScript and Node. I was mostly interested in Games in JavaScript, and NPM Packages. Around this time, I started getting a little active on my GitHub.


### Sharing Projects 

A lot of things that I built in 2018 and 2019 went unnoticed and hardly anyone used my projects. Most of my users were my college friends and my mom :')

I had been reading a lot of [articles from devdevcharlie](https://dev.to/devdevcharlie) about all the cool projects she is working on and that inspired me to write an article about my project. So I wrote [my first article about my project PWAinit](https://dev.to/saurabhdaware/turn-existing-website-to-pwa-in-1-minute-using-pwainit-8do).

Guess what? I got 7 stars on GitHub in 2 days!! I had recieved more GitHub stars in 2 days than in last 2 years! People actually noticing my projects motivated me to write more articles about my projects and more and more people started reacting to my articles. 

Around this time I also started being more active on twitter
