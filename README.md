***Warning: This blog uses unstable version of Abell***

Things I realised that are missing in Abell as of now which I'll have to fix in future versions -
- Can't refer to local images from blog content directly. 
- CSS solution is not good enough. Can't use scoped CSS.
- No Auto-complete in Editor
- `entry.build.ts` becomes too verbose in dynamic paths.
- Too many files in root. (Can add cli param to define root and make src default root)
- CSS inlining not working in Vite.
- No control over bundling.
